## Scheme in Zig

I'm new to Zig and thought it would be an interesting project to implement yet another Scheme interpreter as a practice exercise. I'm also learning about Scheme internals so it's actually two adventures for the price of one!

As most of my other projects, this is forever a work in progress, evolving slowly. I'm trying to follow the R5RS but this may change as we move on. I'm using DrRacket v8.8 to check the correct behavior of the interpreter and its primitives.
