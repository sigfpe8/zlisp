## Scheme in Zig

I'm new to Zig and thought it would be an interesting project to implement yet another Scheme interpreter as a practice exercise. I'm also learning about Scheme internals so it's actually two adventures for the price of one!

As most of my other projects, this is forever a work in progress, evolving slowly. I'm generally trying to follow the [R5RS](https://standards.scheme.org/official/r5rs.pdf) but I adopted the number syntax from [R6RS](https://standards.scheme.org/official/r6rs.pdf). I'm using DrRacket v8.8 to check the correct behavior of the interpreter and its primitives.
